de# masterd-nanosystem
The first fully-automated nano-daemon designed to drive large-scale imaging and document delivery systems.

masterd runs from /usr/locl/bin and simply keeps feeding jobs to an automated document delivery system, including image and signal processing (very large processing tasks requiring compute clusters), then eventually processed by a MySQL-based web server to provide results data in human-readable format. The daemon ran uninterrupted across distributed systems for over 10 years without modification or failure (and ridiculously low down time). The concept is too simple to fail!

The system was directly responsible for making data generated by life science systems available essentially forever, and the servers involved with image and signal processing remained without user logins throughout their lifespans.
